## 🛠️ System Requirements

- **Operating Systems:** This software is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM.
- **Storage:** A minimum of 200 MB of free disk space.
- **KiCad Version:** Ensure you have KiCad version 5.0 or later installed.

## 🔍 Features

- **Extract Information:** Quickly pull details from your KiCad schematics.
- **Group Management:** Automatically categorize components into functional groups.
- **XML Format:** Save your data in a custom Group Netlist XML format.
- **Easy Annotations:** Add simple annotations and let our tool do the rest.

## 🤔 How It Works

kicad_firmware_generation operates on the concept of groups. Each group represents a set of components working together for a specific functionality. Instead of manually defining each connection, you simply annotate your schematic.

### Example Annotations

To illustrate how easy it is, see the example below:
